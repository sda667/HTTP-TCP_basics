# HTTP and TCP Basics

This project analyzes the **HTTP protocol** and its encapsulation within **TCP/IP**.  
It also studies TCP mechanisms such as the three-way handshake, acknowledgments, retransmissions, and congestion control using Wireshark.

## Project Structure
- `HTTP_TCP_Basics.pdf` → Full detailed lab report (LaTeX formatted with figures)
- `HTTP_TCP_Basics.md` → Markdown version of the report 

## Tools
- Wireshark
- TCP/IP packet analysis

## Key Results
- HTTP is a plaintext protocol encapsulated in TCP/IP.  
- TCP ensures reliable delivery via handshake, acknowledgments, and retransmissions.  
- Congestion control and slow start mechanisms are visible in TCP flow graphs.  
- Incorrect requests (wrong URL/port, HTTPS on port 80) highlight protocol limitations.
